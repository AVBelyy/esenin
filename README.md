Esenin is an online music player with Ã  la karaoke lyrics highlighting. The player features six songs with lyrics, all of which are based on the poems of a 20th-century Russian poet [Sergey Esenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Yesenin).

The project was written overnight in 2013 (with minor updates in 2019) as a voluntary coursework for my Russian literature high school course to get more acquainted with Node.JS, CoffeeScript, Express, JADE, and, of course, to commemorate the great poet.

$ docker pull tohnann/esenin
```

### Run the server
